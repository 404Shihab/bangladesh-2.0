        <h2>“The July Movement: A New Dawn”</h2>
        <p>The July Revolution,also known as the July Mass Uprising, Gen Z Revolution or Student-People's Uprising, was a mass uprising in Bangladesh in 2024. It began as a quota reform movement to reform the quota rule for government jobs, after the Supreme Court of Bangladesh invalidated the government's 2018 circular regarding job quotas in the public sector. It began in early June 2024 and was led by the Students Against Discrimination. Coinciding with the first anniversary of the Resignation of Sheikh Hasina, on 5 August 2025, the revolution received constitutional acknowledgment with the announcement of the July Declaration, and it has been described as the world's first Gen Z revolution.</p>
